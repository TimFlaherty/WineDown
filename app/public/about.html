				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					<em>WineDown is focused on bringing our customers the very best possible wine tasting experience!</em> We feel that the best way to taste wines isn't the same for every person, so we offer as much up front information as possible for our customers to find what exactly it is that they like and want.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Our customers are able to choose the wineries they wish to visit</em> based on things such as what is closest, and what others have viewed as great wines, versus the traditional which winery has paid off the advertisers to get their names out there. We believe every experience is unique for each person but want to be able to allow people to share those experiences with others, as well as be able to reflect on their experiences as well. Our aim is to allow people to pick what exactly they're looking for, be it the closest winery, or the highest reviewed by others, we want everyone to use our site to their own advantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time we hope that many users come and leave many reviews about wineries as well as our company but as for now...
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>WineDown started when 4 great people</em> came together with a similar goal of bringing an easier way to access wineries and find their ideal tasting room. Established in 2017, our values will stay forever the same as we strive to bring excellence in finding your tastes without being pushed by the big names into big prices and potentially subpar experiences. We 4 came from humble begginings of a small classroom of 13 people and a teacher wanting us to give our best for ourselves and our futures. WineDown will always strive to improve ourselves and become what our customers expect us to be. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>WineDown is based out of San Francisco, CA</em> with a team of bright eyed and bushy tailed workers, although our bright eyes get a little	brighter every time we find our selves behind a great glass of wine. We're always reachable for new ideas as well as encouragement through	winedownmaps@gmail.com, and can be reached by phone (415)314-6155 between the hours of 9:00am - 5:00pm PST, or find us on facebook or on instagram as well!
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Wine snobs are a dime a dozen in the wine industry,</em> but we think we'll be able to open up a whole new marketplace of customers to wineries by making things less stressful for customers to find the best wines possible! Don't let the other's "knowledge" or opinions dictate the way you experience and taste! Every palate is different, but wine is for everyone to enjoy! WineDown just wants to be a part of that happiness and discovery!
